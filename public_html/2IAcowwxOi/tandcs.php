			Before we begin, some backs need to be covered:<br />
			1. This site is provided as a means for aiding revision, sharing ideas for revision and sharing tutorial and exam questions answers for feedback from other users.<br />
			2. This site is NOT a substitute for actual revision, i.e. working through notes and tutorial and exam questions on ones own time.<br />
			3. This site is hosted on a server for which the webmaster(s) does/do not have full responsibility. Whilst the webmaster(s) will endeavour to ensure that the site remains fully functional, the webmaster(s) cannot guarantee that the site will remain functional 100% of the time, and so they has/have no obligation to ensure the site is functional between midnight and 9am on any day of the week, and, where the webmaster(s) have exams, from 6pm the night before an exam up until the exam ends.<br />
			4. The site moderators have no responsibility to maintain the functionality of the site.

			<p class="entry">
			These terms must be abided by at all times:<br />
			1. This one should be pretty obvious: respect other users. No flaming, trolling or spamming. No discriminatory posts, or any
			post that may cause offence.<br />
			2. Don't post anything that may constitute breaking UK law, or the law of the country in which the post was written. Most importantly:<br />
			DO NOT upload any copyrighted material under any circumstances! You may link to said material on other sites, but don't upload it yourself.<br />
			3. Please report posts that contravene any of these terms. Do not reply to them.<br />
			4. Check to see if the topic you're about to post on is already in the forum. Please don't create duplicate threads, accidentally or otherwise.<br />
			5. Try to control off-topic posts. Don't let threads veer wildly away from the subject.<br />
			6. Don't just create posts that simply agree with previous posts. Please add to the thread, don't repeat.<br />
			7. If you have an ammendment to make, edit your post, don't post anew.<br />
			8. Don't duplicate your comments in multiple forums. I can't see any reason why you'd want to, but please don't.<br />
			9. Don't post anything that'll cause browsers, plugins or any server-side software to crash. Furthermore, if you do find a bug or a security
			 vulnerability, please let the webmaster know as soon as possible, by either emailing the webmaster directly, or using the feedback forum.<br />
			10. If you have any concerns about forum moderation, email the webmaster.<br />
			11. Further to rule 10, if you have anything you want to talk to us about, please use the feedback forum, or email the webmaster.<br />
			12. Don't waste the moderators' time by reporting posts that don't break the forum rules.<br >
			13. Any user who breaks these terms of service more than three times per month will have their account deleted. The number of times that the terms are violated will be counted according to each calendar month and reset at the beginning of each month.

			Some guidelines and suggestions to make everything more convenient for everyone concerned:<br />
			1. If you have any suggestions, feel free to voice them in the Suggestions forum. (More of a guideline than a rule.)<br />			
			2. Try to use the [url] tags when posting a link (click the "insert hyperlink" button when editing a post), as it makes following the link by clicking a lot easier.<br />
			3. There is an equation editor available. For complicated expressions it will come in very handy, though for simple stuff there's probably not much point. Use this in combination with the [math] and [imath] tags.
